## 1. OVERVIEW OF PROBLEM STATEMENT

<P>An overview of water quality prediction involves understanding the methods, techniques, and objectives related to assessing and forecasting the quality of water in various environments.</P>
<P>Access to safe drinking-water is essential to health, a basic human right and a component of effective policy for health protection. This is important as a health and development issue at a national, regional and local level. In some regions, it has been shown that investments in water supply and sanitation can yield a net economic benefit, since the reductions in adverse health effects and health care costs outweigh the costs of undertaking the interventions.</P>

## 2. OBJECTIVE
<UL>
<LI><B>Purpose</B>: The primary goal is to predict or assess the quality of water, ensuring it meets regulatory standards, supports aquatic life, and is safe for human consumption.</LI>
<LI><B>Scope</B>: The scope may vary from local water bodies (e.g., rivers, lakes) to larger ecosystems or industrial discharge points.</LI>
    <LI><B>Prediction and Assessment</B>: The primary objective is to predict and assess the quality of water based on various parameters and indicators.</LI>
    </UL>
<p>Develop a predictive model to accurately estimate water quality.Indicates if water is safe for human consumption where 1 means Potable and 0 means Not potable. 
</p>

## 3. DATA COLLECTION
<p>Uses the read_csv function from pandas to read the CSV file located at the specified path </p>
